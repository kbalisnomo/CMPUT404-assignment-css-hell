          <h3>Who am I?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm Kyle, a 5th year at the University of Alberta 
            studying computer science. I will be graduating 
            in Spring 2022 and am currently looking for career 
            opportunities. For hobbies I enjoy playing video 
            games and am a part of a recreational volleyball team!

      <h3>Professional History</h3>
      <p>
        Most recently I have worked a 16 month internship at INVIDI Technologies as a Software Developer Intern. There I worked 
        on a scrum team of 6 to develop microservices in Kotlin deployed to AWS. I learned much about agile practices involving 
        daily standup, sprint planning, retrospectives, etc. Before this position I had never worked with cloud computing and 
        learned a lot about AWS (specficially the following services Lambda, SQS, S3 API Gateway, CloudFormation).
      </p>
      <h3>What I Have To Offer</h3>
      <p>
        I can code in Kotlin and Python. In terms of front-end development I have prior experience using REACT to 
        create a web application for ISSS, a student group at the University of Alberta. At my internship we mostly 
        focused on back-end development utilizing Kotlin however I also have experience using Python frameworks such as Django.
